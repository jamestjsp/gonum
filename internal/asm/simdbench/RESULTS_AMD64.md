Native SIMD tuning against AMD64 assembly, 2026-09-04 US/Central.

This is the report supplied with the AMD64 patch bundle, not a rerun on the
integration host. Raw samples and the runner remain on the source AMD64 machine
and were not included in the bundle. Integration subsequently added a
non-finite complex-dot retry and retained faster portable fallbacks; remeasure
the integrated revision on AMD64 before treating these timings as current.
See [ARM64 integration validation](RESULTS_IMPORT.md).

SIMD now beats ASM in 34 of 114 kernel/size cases, loses 68, and is statistically inconclusive in 12. At the larger sizes it wins 30 of 57 cases, loses 23, and is inconclusive in 4. These counts use per-case benchstat tests at alpha=0.05 without a multiple-comparison correction. The preceding branch benchmark had 16 wins overall. This is a substantial improvement in the candidate kernels; production AMD64 BLAS dispatch remains assembly.

Base: e925697fb16c99cbbe52cf4a489f1e6f503923db on codex/arm64-simd-blas. Tuning branch: codex/simd-beat-asm. Compared with base SIMD, 42 cases improved significantly, 68 were inconclusive, and 4 regressed. The equally weighted geometric mean of kernel times fell 44.15%; this is not an application speedup.

Intel Core i7-11850H, Linux amd64, Go 1.27.1, GOEXPERIMENT=simd, GOAMD64=v1, 512-bit runtime vectors, GOMAXPROCS=1, CPU2 affinity. Six 50ms samples per case, using prebuilt binaries with ASM/new/base order reversed on alternating rounds. The same current binary contains ASM and tuned candidates; base SIMD comes from the unmodified e925697f source export. Governor remains powersave and the SMT sibling was not isolated. All 2052 timed measurements completed with zero bytes/allocations per call. Timing is a comparison on this CPU, not native ARM64 or AVX256 performance evidence.

Representative medians, in ns/op. All highlighted improvements versus ASM below have p=0.002, n=6; GemvN is inconclusive.

Implementation changes:

- Contiguous complex arithmetic works on interleaved vectors; it no longer deinterleaves every element into scratch arrays. AMD64 complex128 leaves avoid the missing portable shuffle and Go 1.27.1 FromArch stack copies.
- Mixed-precision unitary dot uses vector widening and independent accumulators in AMD64 leaves. Disassembly confirms VCVTPS2PD with register arithmetic and no conversion bridge spills in the hot loop.
- Matrix kernels share input loads across four rows and avoid per-row dispatch/setup. Rectangular benchmarks include padding and dimensions from 7x9 through 512x512. Wide matrices benefit; tiny/tall-narrow shapes can still favor ASM. Large Gemv cases are approximately tied or gain only a few percent.
- Ordinary L2 magnitudes use direct vector sums of squares. Overflow, nonfinite values and sums below a conservative underflow-error threshold retry the scaled recurrence. Extreme/subnormal tests use a 256-bit arithmetic reference. The headline norm timings use ordinary magnitudes.
- Fixed assembly AXPY counter underflow after consuming a one-element alignment prefix, and valid 4-byte complex64 alignment in both assembly AXPY routines. Fixed sequential write dependencies for zero increments and overlapping SIMD index streams.

The first full screen exposed short-call regressions from a horizontal-reduction helper and an inlined contiguous-dot branch. The helper was discarded and dot dispatch moved outside the generic loop; the final results above include these corrections. Initial 100ms screens in the parent directory are retained as investigation evidence, not the final result.

Four final base-SIMD comparisons remain slower: c128 AxpyInc n31 +4.40%, n4096 +5.62%, c128 AxpyIncTo n31 +5.34%, and f32 AxpyIncTo n4096 +7.09%. Complex increment paths now carry dependency/alias guards required for correctness. The f32 AxpyIncTo source is unchanged from base; this run alone does not establish why its timing differs. General-stride staging and small-call overhead remain follow-up work in Ergo FQ6C3R. No universal assembly replacement or cutoff is claimed.

Validation completed after the corrections:

- `GOEXPERIMENT=simd go test ./...` — full suite passed, including unfiltered SIMD equivalence/allocation tests.
- All f32/f64/c64/c128 tests and the shared comparison suite passed at `GODEBUG=simd=0`, `128`, `256`, `512`.
- ARM64 cross-builds of all four affected numeric test binaries passed; no native ARM64 performance claim.
- Default, safe and noasm internal-ASM/BLAS tests passed; Go1.24.0 compatibility checks passed.
- Race tests of the four numeric packages and simdbench passed.
- gofmt/goimports, repository import and copyright checks, and git diff --check passed.

The SIMD API and compiler are experimental. Toolchain release status was checked against the [Go release history](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release); the implementation uses the installed Go1.27.1 source as the API authority. Recheck missing operations and generated code before retaining architecture-specific workarounds on a future Go version.

Raw evidence is retained on the source AMD64 machine in `benchmark-results/simd-tuned/final/` with the repeated-sample runner and machine metadata. It is not part of this repository or the imported bundle. See the [comparison instructions](README.md) to build the same candidate/assembly harness.
