# Go SIMD development findings

Checked 2026-09-04 (America/Chicago). These are compiler-development findings,
not Gonum benchmark results or a release commitment. The supported experiment
for this work remains Go 1.27.1 with `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`.

as well as [dev.simd](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.simd).
Much of the newer SIMD performance work is now proposed directly on master.

## Patterns applicable now

- Keep a matrix output tile in vector accumulators across the inner dimension;
  reuse each scalar broadcast across multiple strips. The experimental
  [SVE SGEMM kernel, CL 827812](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/827812)
  (`6b8e07c91f38e60be2d8a5fe09a82af557a23fef`, open) uses sliced rows,
  `j+vl <= len(row)`, explicit `s[off:off+vl]` loads, and incrementally advanced
  offsets. Its SVE predicate-hoisting trick is not a NEON optimization.
- Hoist invariant broadcasts, masks, and shuffle constants explicitly.
  [SIMD loop-invariant-code motion, CL 803220](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/803220)
  (`ecafbe48e206bd28e53385cb78e4448e1a5eb1b5`) is still open/WIP.
- Keep hot arithmetic in vectors. Go 1.27.1's
  [FromArch implementation](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/tags/go1.27.1/src/simd/tofrom_amd64.go)
  relies on inlining to eliminate conversion code. Check generated instructions
  before introducing a bridge inside a loop; a narrow whole-kernel leaf may
  avoid repeated stack copies.
- Choose unrolling from measured register pressure and loop instructions.
  Extra accumulators can hide arithmetic latency but also introduce spills.
  Test floating-point cancellation, extreme magnitudes, and fallback paths
  when using fused arithmetic or changing reduction order.

## Compiler and API changes to recheck

| Change | Status at inspection | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| [CL 825146](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/825146), `9cb51e7a659ee21720d79e84309b7add66f9b40d` | Open | VEX encodings for spills, moves, and scalar transfers address [AVX/SSE transition penalties](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/80835). Retest integer-staging workarounds after it ships. |
| [CL 824624](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/824624), `fcc582225c8550b3663cce3b2e68376bc01ebc2b` | Open | Packed FMA231 accumulation can remove copies caused by FMA213's overwritten multiplicand. This does not also implement embedded memory broadcast. |
| [CL 827904](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/827904), `d8d13647598ede1b01de5c607f1d98bcce8dee21` | Open | NEON broadcast lowering removes redundant zero-vector initialization and scalar insertion before DUP. |
| [CL 827424](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/827424), `ba7fdba26bb5f9698a0ccd719c49d5ba2d1327a2` | Merged on master | Float archsimd `ReduceSum` uses pairwise adds and low/high-half reductions. These arithmetic trees can already be expressed with Go 1.27.1 intrinsics. |
| [CL 827464](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/827464), `501c052c3e0220d2b1c3018ae2da9dbe1e049659` | Open | Exposes portable float `ReduceSum`; absent from Go 1.27.1. |
| [CL 817020](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/817020), `0cc58e9616765a4c9211f96ea462ab091216bff4` | Open | Adds a NEON variant without hardware PMULL, avoiding whole-program portable SIMD emulation on affected ARM64 hosts. |
| [CL 768264](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/768264), `ab1d580d957a77eaf35f4ef93017bd880c532013` | Open on dev.simd | Experiments with high AVX512 registers to avoid overlap with scalar SSE registers. |

The installed Go 1.27.1 portable API has neither float32-to-float64 widening nor
float horizontal reductions or complex lane permutations. Retain measured
widening/permutation leaves until an available portable operation and generated
code justify replacing them. The developing reduction API is not a prefix-scan
API; it does not by itself eliminate cumulative-sum staging.

## Compatibility gate

[Portable SIMD](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/78902) is accepted as an
experiment. [Default AMD64 enablement](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/78979)
and the [CPU-feature vet proposal](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/76175)
remain on hold. [SVE](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/79781) has active
implementation work but is not a capability of the Apple M1 benchmark host.
Do not remove experiment or CPU-feature guards from proposal status alone.

For each new release, verify the actual API and feature contracts, then compare
the same source and benchmark harness on native ARM64 and AMD64, including
supported vector widths and emulation. Remove a workaround only after numerical
tests, generated-code inspection, and repeated timings support the change.
